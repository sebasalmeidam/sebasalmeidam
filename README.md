More than 8 years of experience in the technology industry, I have lead projects, my start up, and worked as a software engineer in a fast growth SAAS wordlwide startup.

Before becoming a full-time web developer, I was a business consultant for more than 8 years, I'm a project manager professional (PMP certified), I have a certification in Business Modeling from Wharton (UPenn), so I understand clients and business needs and how to find different approaches to solve problems.
